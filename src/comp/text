Hello #connections,
During my exciting journey of learning React JS, I have created this stunning Search UI called ExploreX, which serves you with the top search results based on the search_term. The UI is elegantly designed using Tailwind CSS classes, and the functionality is implemented with React Functional Components, utilizing #api for real-time result calling.

It saddens me that I cannot host it on certain platforms due to some limitations of the free version of the API. But not to worry! I'm delighted to share a preview of ExploreX with all of you.
